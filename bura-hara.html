      Most of the Japanese population is type A. People with this blood type are described 
      primarily as kichōmen 几帳面, or well-organized. They like to keep things neat but can 
      be stubborn and get stressed out easily. They also value harmony with others.
       Agricultural people are the root of blood type A, and it's been said working 
       collaboratively on farms developed these blood type personality traits.

     Blood type B is generally described as jikochū 自己中, or selfish. They are also known for their creativity. Blood type B has a strong sense of curiosity, but at the same time, loses interest easily. Though there are a lot of positives to B types, people tend to focus on the negatives for reasons we'll get into later. Some say their root is in nomadic peoples who roamed from place to place.

      Blood type O is often described as rakkanshugi 楽観主義, or optimistic. They are outgoing, have leadership abilities, and are able to set the mood for groups of people. They don't care much about little things (as you can see from the mikan picture above), so their behavior sometimes freaks out more sensitive A types. Though they're often late to events (and sometimes rude), O types are incredibly resilient and flexible, enabling them to roll with the punches.

      Blood type AB is a hybrid of A and B, two different personalities mixed together. They are often seen as dual-natured and complicated. For example, they are shy like A types, but also are outgoing like type B. Blood type AB is the rarest in Japan (and many other places in the world, too), so they are hard to find. This reinforces the stereotype that AB people are are kawarimono 変わり者, or eccentric.
